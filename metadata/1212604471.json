{"name":"Airdropped Shit #3","description":"“Spontaneously, without any theological training, I, a child, grasped the incompatibility of God and shit and thus came to question the basic thesis of Christian anthropology, namely that man was created in God's image. Either/or: either man was created in God's image - and has intestines! - or God lacks intestines and man is not like him.\n\nThe ancient Gnostics felt as I did at the age of five. In the second century, the Great Gnostic master Valentinus resolved the damnable dilemma by claiming that Jesus \"ate and drank, but did not defecate.\"\n\nShit is a more onerous theological problem than is evil. Since God gave man freedom, we can, if need be, accept the idea that He is not responsible for man's crimes. The responsibility for shit, however, rests entirely with Him, the creator of man.”\n― Milan Kundera","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Author","value":"Milan Kundera"},{"trait_type":"Palette","value":"Paul Gauguin"},{"trait_type":"Num colors","value":"3"},{"trait_type":"Style","value":"Clean shit"},{"value":"Don't Know shit #6"},{"value":"Don't Know shit #8"},{"value":"Holy shit #1"},{"value":"Holy shit #3"},{"value":"Don't Know shit #3"},{"value":"Holy shit #6"},{"value":"Don't Know shit #1"},{"value":"Don't Know shit #7"}],"image":"https://www.the23.wtf/images/1212604471.png"}
