# The 100 Pieces of Shit

In 1961, Manzoni created small cans titled Artist's Shit, and said it was a joke, a parody of the art market, and a critique of consumerism and the waste it generates.


60 years later, this is the #NFT remake, 100 pieces of shit swimming in the [open sea.](https://opensea.io/collection/the100pieces)


## The Experiment

* Collection deployed on Friday Oct 23rd, 2021. 

* Sent links to friends and work contacts.

* Sent Discord and twitter DMs to +100 random people.

* Airdropped 25 pieces to the top chain runners, Ponzi Rugs and Fudderverse holders (Jan 2022.)

* Airdropped 11 pieces to the top Goblin Lill Poop Collectors (June 2022.)

* Some people enjoyed the theme, and minted or received their first NFT from this collection.

* Sent #99, Sympathy to the Devil, to ahopkins.eth.

* Total proceeds: 18 authentic mints * 0.04 = 0.72 ETH, all the rest of the collection was given away to friends or airdropped.

* Total cost: about 1 Eth in transaction fees, plus a 0.1 Chain Runner XR NFT to be given away as a prize for a Puzzle Challenge.

* After the collection minted out, a wallet holding 5 pieces and a prize was created. The first person who solves the riddles will be able to steal its contents.

* The minting website was turned off, and the collection metadata and images moved to github, where they will live in a semi-decentralized mode.

* All holders welcome to submit a PR if they would like to modify their NFT. (Please provide a cryptographic signature of the PR url.)


## The Final Piece: Of Bears and Bulls

In our narrow, confined existence, we tend to forget the essence of life...

All of us, whatever our occupation or class, are equally guilty: the employer is lost in the running of his business; the workers, sunk in the abyss of their misery, raise their heads only to cry in protest; we, the politicians, are lost in daily battles and corridor intrigues.

All of us forget that before everything else, we are men, ephemeral beings lost in the immense universe, so full of terrors.

We are inclined to neglect the search for the real meaning of life, to ignore the real goals - serenity of the spirit and sublimity of the heart...

To reach them - that is the revolution.
